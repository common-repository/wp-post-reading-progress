Add time to read or progress bar to your posts and pages!

== Description ==
A plugin that adds the reading time and the reading progress to single posts, pages or both of them.

At this moment, there is no support for custom post types. It will be added at a later time.

The information box shows a progress bar, which will complete once you scroll the content.

Going back up, it will empty the progress bar.

It also calculates and shows the total reading time for the page/post.

You can change the bar colors and add the bar to the top, bottom, left or right side of the screen .

The default location is static, before the content and then floated, once the scroll view passes the box location.

You can also choose if you want to show the total reading time, only the progress, or both and if you want to show it on posts only, pages only, or on both of them.


Options page is found as a sub-menu link in Settings area.

It can be used as it is, or can be easily modified with CSS from your theme or other plugins.
It will inherit the fonts and most of the spacing directly for your theme.

Optionally, the settings can be removed from the database, once the plugin uninstalls.
